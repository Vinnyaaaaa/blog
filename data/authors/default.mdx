I’m a Software Engineer specializing in JavaScript technologies with over 3 years of experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications.

👨‍💻 I’ve worked extensively with frameworks, focusing on performance optimization

⚡user interface enhancements and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver exceptional web experiences.

🌐In addition to development, I create tech content primarily about Web Development and JavaScript.

While coding is my main focus, I also enjoy exploring and discussing other tech topics

🔍Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by learning Go (Golang) to become a more versatile developer 🚀.
